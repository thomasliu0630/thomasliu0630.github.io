Hi, I'm a second-year undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo. I am enrolled in the Mathematics/Financial Analysis and Risk Management co-op program and am currently seeking Fall 2020 internships!
I am a passionate individual and quick learner who demonstrates great collaboration and communication skills through learning. Some of my current interests are Data Analysis and Investment Management, as well
as Venture Capital and Private Equity. Outside of academics, my favourite pastimes are basketball and piano. I also love to get involved in extracurricular activites at school! I am currently a member of
the Financial Analysis and Risk Manangement Student Association (FARMSA), Univesity of Waterloo Finance Association (UWFA), and Data Science Club.
